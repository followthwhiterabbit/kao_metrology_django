"\t\tAir gaging, also known as pneumatic gaging or air gauging, \n"
"    is a metrological technique used for precision measurements in "
"manufacturing and quality control processes. \n"
"    It involves the use of compressed air to measure dimensional "
"characteristics of a workpiece. \n"
"    The basic principle of air gaging is to use the interaction between a "
"stream of pressurized air and the surface of the workpiece to make accurate "
"measurements.\n"

"Air gaging is commonly used in situations where high precision is required, "
"especially in industries like machining, automotive manufacturing, and "
"aerospace. It is known for its speed, accuracy, and the ability to measure "
"tight tolerances. Air gaging is particularly suitable for measuring features "
"like bores, grooves, and other internal dimensions where traditional contact "
"methods might be challenging or impractical."
