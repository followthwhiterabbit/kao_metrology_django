"\n"
"                Leak testing in metrology refers to the process of checking "
"for and identifying leaks in a sealed or pressurized system.\n"
"                 This is a crucial step in quality control and assurance, "
"especially in industries where maintaining airtight or fluid-tight integrity "
"is essential. \n"
"                 Leak testing is commonly employed in the manufacturing of "
"products such as automotive components, medical devices, electronic devices, "
"and various other industrial applications.\n"
